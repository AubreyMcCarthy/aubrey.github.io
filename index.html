				<p>OlliOlli World is an exhilarating skating action platformer, set in the vibrant quirky and cozy world
					of Radlandia.</p>
				<p>On the project <strong>my main achievement was writing the <em>No Comply Renderer</em></strong>.
					Which is responsible for rendering the game, by harnessing <em>Unity&#39;s Scriptable Render
						Pipeline</em>. <strong>Creating it&#39;s distinctive cartoon art style.</strong></p>
				<p>The <em>No Comply Renderer</em> is the many <strong>shaders used on the characters, environment, and
						post processes</strong>. As well as the code that glues it all together.</p>

				<div class="more-content">
					<p>One of the main stars of the show in <strong>OlliOlli World is the beautiful pastel colour
							pallet</strong>. The game has many many levels, and we wanted each level to be a
						continuation of the evolving colour story that&#39;s building through each of biome.</p>

					<p>I created a <strong><em>Meta Gradient Texture</em> system and workflow for the artists to
							use.</strong> Every environment asset is mapped to a shared texture, which is responsible
						for the colour that you see in the level. </p>
					<p>This had the dual benefits of allowing the Lead Artist to direct and change the feel of the level
						as a whole, any time and completely non-destructively. As well as meaning an artist creating a
						level could easily take art from different levels and reuse them. The colours of this asset
						already matching the rest of the current environment, as soon as you drop it in the level.</p>

					</div> -->
					<p>I also supported the 3D artists with their art creation process, this style of rendering needing
						the art to be made in a non-standard way. Including quality of life improvements in their art
						programs, going from 3D software to engine, and in engine tools.</p>

				<p>While working on OlliOlli World, Roll7 had another team prototyping Rollerdrome. <strong>I wrote the
						<em>No Comply Renderer</em> to be flexible and support the art styles of both OlliOlli World and
						Rollerdrome at the same time.</strong></p>
				<p>Rollerdrome is the Bafta winning, fast and blisteringly fun combat chess game on rollerskates. If Tony Hawk Pro Skater
					and Doom had a baby, it would probably look like Rollerdrome.</p>
				<p>Rollerdrome targeting next gen meant there was extra graphics headroom. Which meant getting to write
					additional rendering features like a decal system. As well as <strong>writing the core shaders for
						the characters, environments, and post processes.</strong> </p>
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">More...</button>
				<div class="more-content">
					<p>As I was sharing my time between the two projects and they had similar artistic needs many of
						<strong>the tools and workflows were designed to be project agnostic</strong>. With modularity
						and performance in mind, supporting low end devices like OlliOlli World targeting 60 fps on
						Nintendo Switch, up to Rollerdrome targeting 4k 120fps on Playstation 5.
					</p>
					<p>The <em>Meta Gradient Texture</em> system for example, was in both projects. As was much of the
						workflow used by artists. This was good because despite having a non-standard art pipeline,
						artists could be shared between both projects when it was required, with little retraining.</p>
					<img src="Images/Rollerdrome-Ice.jpg" width="100%">
					<p>I&#39;m very fond of character lighting in Rollerdrome. The visuals are so stylised, and the
						gameplay fast paced, we decided to divorce the character lighting from the environment. The
						lighting and shadow drawn by the player are directed by special volumes placed by the
						environment artists. This keeps the player clear and readable no matter where they are, or how
						frantic the action.</p>

				<p>John Wick Hex is a tactics game where you conduct John Wick&#39;s lethal actions, set in an inky noir
					world.</p>
				<p>I wrote the shaders which render the characters, environments, post process which gives the game
					it&#39;s comic book like feel.</p>
				<p>I was also responsible for <strong>making the majority of the game&#39;s VFX and environment
						art</strong>. Including a procedural room generator, which allowed for rectangular rooms to be
					build on a hexagonal grid.</p>
				<p>And <strong>the <em>Fog of War</em> system</strong>, which means anything not in Wick&#39;s active
					line of sight recedes into the murky darkness.</p>

				<p>Arca&#39;s path is a serine and colourful VR platform game, which not everything is as peaceful as it
					seams.</p>
				<p>I was brought on to <strong>Arca&#39;s Path to optimise the game and make sure it looks it&#39;s
						best</strong> from our low end platform of Gear VR, up to PSVR and high end PC VR rigs.</p>
				<p>I stayed on to do additional support for the environment art team. Creating shaders, VFX, and the
					<strong>novel Level Of Detail system used to support the limited draw distance of the
						hardware</strong>, while fitting in the artistic tone of the world.

				<p>The Mannequin was a first person horror game set against the backdrop of The Windrush Generation and
					social inequality in London. But was fated to never be released.</p>
				<p>I was the environment artist responsible for making the London townhouse the game is set in. As well
					as lighting, and helping develop the painterly style.</p>
